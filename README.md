# calfrathouse

a website to organize our college house lol.

Some incredible features include:
- seeing all ur roommates horrendous profile pictures!
- seeing how many kidney's you need to sell to make rent next month!
- looking at the lease agreement that just so happened to required you to sell your soul!

jk but seriously this is a website that organizes chores, costs, all lease/roommate documents, etc. 

If you want to use this for your own purposes, just make a fork of this repo & provide an uploadcare cdn public key + a mongoDB public key in your `.env` file. 

Then simply run `npm run dev` & enjoy!

This project is live [here](https://rent.mehdi.us)!
